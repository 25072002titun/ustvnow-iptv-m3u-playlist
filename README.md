# ustvnow-iptv-m3u-playlist
Using your login details this script can grab the m3u8 links from the USTVNOW website. It's nothing fancy, I made it because the current scripts out there don't work! And I wanted to watch American TV via an IPTV client rather than via a website or addon. Running this script with print out the video links. 

Enjoy :)
